A simple tiktok Multi-tool i made in python

## How can I install and use this?

1. Git-clone this repo & change directory

2. Right click on  the folder  where you unzipped  the .zip

3. Click open terminal  here:
if  you have windows  terminal, then on settings  set  the default  console  to open is  powershell
if you dont have windows  terminal then you can get it here (this is optional, i  suggest this because  you can open many different  consoles  with this program that you get on the windows  store)

4. Install modules using pip (in powershell):
   <pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
   
5. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed
