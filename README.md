# Tiktok-Multi-tool
A simple tiktok Multi-tool i made in python

## How can I install and use this?

1. Git-clone this repo & change directory

2. Right click on  the folder  where you unzipped  the .zip

3. Click open terminal  here:
if  you have windows  terminal, then on settings  set  the default  console  to open is  powershell
if you dont have windows  terminal then you can get it here (this is optional, i  suggest this because  you can open many different  consoles  with this program that you get on the windows  store)

4. Install modules using pip:
   <pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
   
5. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed

6. Run the .py file!
   <pre>python tiktodv3.py</pre>



## Note
When  it  says  copy tiktok video  url, it means  the url from chrome, not from  copy url  feature that tiktok has

The first recaptcha has to be completed manually.
